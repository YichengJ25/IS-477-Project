# Project Plan

## Overview
The goal of our project is to design and implement an end-to-end data lifecycle workflow. We will acquire, integrate, and analyze two different datasets in order to answer meaningful research questions, while ensuring ethical data handling, reproducibility, and transparency. The final deliverable will include data collection, storage, integration, cleaning, quality assessment, and analysis supported by code, documentation, and metadata.

## Research Question(s)
- Question 1: [Insert your first research question here]  
- Question 2: [Insert your second research question here, if applicable]  

## Team
- **Member A (Name)**: Responsible for dataset collection, data cleaning, and documentation.  
- **Member B (Name)**: Responsible for analysis, workflow automation, and report writing.  

Both members will collaborate on integration, quality assessment, and final presentation.

## Datasets
- **Dataset 1**: Describe the dataset (source, type, size, variables, and why it is relevant).  
- **Dataset 2**: Describe the dataset (source, type, size, variables, and why it is relevant).  

These datasets will be chosen from distinct sources and schemas to satisfy the project requirement for integration.

## Timeline
| Week | Task | Responsible Member |
|------|------|---------------------|
| Week 1 | Collect datasets, document metadata | Member A |
| Week 2 | Data cleaning and storage strategy | Member A |
| Week 3 | Integration of datasets (Python/Pandas or SQL) | Both |
| Week 4 | Exploratory data analysis and quality assessment | Member B |
| Week 5 | Modeling, workflow automation | Member B |
| Week 6 | Draft report (Project README.md) | Both |
| Week 7 | Final project release (code, data, documentation) | Both |

## Constraints
- Limited time during the semester to complete all phases of the data lifecycle.  
- Potential challenges in accessing or cleaning datasets.  
- GitHub repository size limits for storing large datasets (mitigated by storing raw data externally if necessary).  

## Gaps
- Final selection of datasets is pending.  
- Need to decide on the specific integration approach (Pandas merge, SQL join, or both).  
- May require additional guidance on ethical/legal constraints such as licensing and data usage terms.

*Note: This plan anticipates later course topics (workflow automation, reproducibility, metadata) and will evolve as the project progresses.*
